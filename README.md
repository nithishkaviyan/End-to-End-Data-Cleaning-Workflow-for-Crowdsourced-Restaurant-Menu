# End-to-End-Data-Cleaning-Workflow-for-Crowdsourced-Restaurant-Menu
 
 A commonly mentioned fact is that every data scientist spends about 80% of the time in cleaning the data and preparing the data for analysis. For more complex tasks this may consume upto 90% of the time. 
 
 A data cleaning workflow provides solution to this problem. It helps to automate data cleaning by capturing the cleaning tasks in an ordered manner. The workflow is usually expressed in flowcharts for different operations. 
 
 In this project, we have performed data cleaning tasks and provided a data cleaning workflow for a Crowdsourced Restaurant Menu contained in NYPL. The data gets updated twice every month in the NYPL website. 
 
 Data Cleaning operations were performed using OpenRefine, Python, and SQLITE3 and Workflow was modelled using YesWorkFlow tool.
 
 All the operations performed were compiled into a report which is attached in this folder.
